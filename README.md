# Arithmetical Triangle

## Abstract
A user interface for generating the coefficients of expanded binomial powers using recursive iteration and the even-odd symmetry of the arithmetic triangle, so that the coefficients can be iterated through from the centre outward, or from outward toward the center of the triangular row. **Project is in completion phase.**
