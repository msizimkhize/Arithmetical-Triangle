# Arithmetical Triangle

## Abstract
A user inerface for generating the coefficients of expandered binomial powers using tecursive iteration and the even-odd symmetry of the arithmetic triangle, so that the coeffecients can be iterated through from the centre outward, or from outward toward the center of the triangular row. **Project is in completion phase.**
